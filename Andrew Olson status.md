Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

My program takes an input, either a single date or a date range, and then using turtle graphics it displays the locations of all arrests in Baltimore, either on that day or in that date range

The program checks to make sure the given date/date range is valid, then shows the map

The stamp on the mad is red for felonies, orange for misdemeanors, and gray for unknown. It also displays the number of arrests in each district and the number of felony/misdemeanor arrests in the terminal

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I can't decide whether to print the district and felony statistics in the terminal or if I should find a way to display those stats on the map somewhere

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

No problems,
