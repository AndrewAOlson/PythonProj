# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

I found a database of every arrest made in Baltimore over the past 5 years with location and time data, so I was thinking of creating a program that allows the user to input a date or range of dates and all arrests during that time are plotted on a map of Baltimore using turtle graphics, with different color coding for the felony/misdemeanor and organizing it by district. Could also print various stats for the time period like which district had most/fewest arrests, violent crime %, bunch of other stuff

Make hangman and draw the hangman using turtle graphics, or make battleship and draw the board with turtle graphics

Make a poker hand simulator and possibly develop a way to play against the computer

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I'm gonna work by myself

## Do you have any questions of your own?

N/A
