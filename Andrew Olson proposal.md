# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

BPD Arrest Database Visualizer 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A program that maps the arrests in Baltimore over a given time period

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The program will ask the user for a day/time period that they would like to see arrest data from, the program will open the database that has the arrest data and plot each arrest during that time period on a map of Baltimore using turtle graphics. If it does not have a location, it will be added to a counter of arrests at unknown locations. The data points will be color coordinated by the charge, something like red for felony, yellow for misdemeanor.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I will get the program to accurately plot the arrests on the map and have the correct color coding for the charge. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I think I will be able to print out some statistics, such as how many felonies there were or which charge had the most arrests.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope to be able to split up the city map by district so the user can see which district had the most arrests, and then also output some statistics on how many arrests occurred in each district, but that might be difficult because the districts are oddly shaped.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will need to research the different charge codes that are in the database so I will know the difference between felony/misdemeanor codes. I also need to research the Baltimore city police districts so I can draw them on the map. I will also look at the code from the hurricane assignment to learn how to set a background for a turtle window and use latitude and longitude data to plot data points. I also need to implement some way to read dates or a range of dates.
